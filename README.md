Project Euler solutions
=======================

Here are my solutions to the problems at <https://projecteuler.net/>, and a test harness for checking them.

Multiple solutions per problem are allowed.  The test harness accepts multiple arguments, which are each either a test number or a path to a solution (which must be relative and contain the problem number as the first directory component).  Running the test harness with no arguments checks the solutions for all problems to which it has answers.
